The greenhouse management system will provide monitoring and control of the most vital parameters of the crop lifecycle. 
- Monitoring of air temperature
- Monitoring of air humidity
- Monitoring and controlling of water pH level
- Monitoring of soil moisture

The system will be equipped with motion sensor which will detect any abnormal movements in the greenhouse. 

The system's main controller will be connected to the local Wi-Fi or the local network via cable. All the essential features, the graphical representation of the data in time of the system, can be monitored through the application provided.
