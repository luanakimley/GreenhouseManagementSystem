# GreenhouseManagementSystem

This is a repository for 3rd year Computing in Software Development Universal Design Principles and IoT Development project.

The greenhouse management system will provide monitoring and control of the most vital parameters of the crop lifecycle. 
•	    Monitoring of Temperature of Air
•	    Monitoring Humidity of the Air
•	    Monitoring and Control of pH level of the water
•	    Monitoring Moisture of the soil

The system will be equipped with motion sensor which will detect any abnormal movements in the greenhouse.
